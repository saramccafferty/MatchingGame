# MatchingGame

MatchingGame is a word-matching game for young children to help them associate words with images.

This was created as part of an app build challenge partway through the RMIT deesign and develop an iOS App course I completed. 
The app briefing included requirements for the app to compile and run in Xcode without any errors. Players should earn a point when they pick the image which matches the word displayed and the game should finish after all words have been displayed and the user is notified when the game ends, including their final score.

For design, the app should present well on iPad and iPhone devices in portrait mode and the user's score must be visible all the time while playing. 

Functionally, the app should shuffle words every time the game starts, show one word after another, and keep showing the current score. When players choose the correct picture, they get a point, and the next word comes up. If they're wrong, no points are given. The game ends when all words are used, and players see their score and a message.
